SQL (Structured Query Language) is fundamentally about **managing and interacting with data in relational databases**. Its core components can be broken down into four main categories, each akin to basic programming constructs like loops or conditions but tailored to data manipulation:

---

### **1. CRUD Operations (Basic Commands)**

These correspond to actions you perform on data:

- **SELECT**: Retrieves data from the database.
    
- **INSERT**: Adds new data into the database.
    
- **UPDATE**: Modifies existing data.
    
- **DELETE**: Removes data.
    

> Analogy: These are like the "verbs" of programming—actions you take with data.

---

### **2. Query Logic (Conditions and Filters)**

SQL uses conditions and logic to filter and shape data:

- **WHERE**: Applies conditions to narrow down results (like `if` statements).
    
- **AND, OR, NOT**: Combines multiple conditions.
    
- **CASE**: Adds conditional logic to queries (similar to `if-else`).
    

> Analogy: These are SQL's equivalent of conditional statements in programming.

---

### **3. Iteration via Bulk Operations**

While SQL lacks explicit loops (e.g., `for` or `while`), its operations inherently process sets of rows at once:

- **Joins**: Combine multiple tables row by row based on relationships.
    
- **GROUP BY**: Aggregates data into categories (e.g., calculate totals).
    
- **HAVING**: Filters aggregated data.
    
- **Window Functions**: Perform calculations across a set of table rows, akin to sliding windows.
    

> Analogy: SQL implicitly loops over datasets by applying operations to every row.

---

### **4. Data Structure and Constraints**

SQL also focuses on how data is structured and validated:

- **CREATE, ALTER, DROP**: Define and modify database schemas (e.g., tables, indexes).
    
- **Constraints**: Ensure data integrity (e.g., `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL`).
    

> Analogy: These are like defining variables, data types, and rules in programming.

---

### **Special Features**

SQL has unique elements not directly analogous to programming constructs:

- **Joins**: Relate and combine data across multiple tables.
    
- **Set Operations**: Combine results from multiple queries (`UNION`, `INTERSECT`).
    
- **Subqueries**: Nest queries inside one another.

### **The Big Picture**

SQL isn't just a series of commands—it operates declaratively. Instead of describing _how_ to do something (like loops in programming), you declare _what_ you want, and the database engine determines how to execute it efficiently.



### **1. Basic SELECT and Filtering**

You’re analyzing sales data in a table called `orders` with columns: `order_id`, `customer_id`, `order_date`, `total_amount`.

**Question:**  
Write a query to return all orders placed in the month of March 2024 where the `total_amount` was greater than $500.

---

### **2. Aggregation and GROUP BY**

You have a table `customers` with: `customer_id`, `region`, `signup_date`.

**Question:**  
Write a query to show the number of customers per region who signed up in 2023.

---

### **3. JOIN for Contextual Data**

There are two tables:

- `orders(order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount)`
    
- `customers(customer_id, name, region)`
    

**Question:**  
Write a query to list each customer's name, region, and the total amount they spent in 2024.

---

### **4. Subquery for Filtering**

In the `orders` table, you want to identify customers who placed more than 5 orders in 2023.

**Question:**  
Write a query to return the `customer_id`s of those customers.

---

### **5. Window Function for Ranking**

From the `orders` table, you want to rank orders by `total_amount` **within each customer**.

**Question:**  
Write a query that adds a column `spend_rank` which shows the rank of each order per customer based on `total_amount`, highest to lowest.
