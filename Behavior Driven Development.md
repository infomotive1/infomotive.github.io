**Behavior Driven Development (BDD)** is a software development approach that builds upon Test Driven Development (TDD) by focusing on the **behavior** of an application from the **end user's perspective**. It's meant to improve communication between developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders.
### Core Concepts

1. **Describe behavior, not implementation**
    
    - Focus on what the system should do, not how it's done.
        
    - Uses natural language constructs like _Given, When, Then_ to describe scenarios.
        
2. **Collaboration**
    
    - Encourages collaboration between developers, QA, and business stakeholders.
        
    - Helps ensure everyone has a shared understanding of what the software should do.
        
3. **Executable specifications**
    
    - Scenarios written in plain language are directly executable as automated tests.

### Example (in Gherkin syntax)

```gherkin
Feature: Login

  Scenario: Successful login
    Given a registered user
    When they enter valid credentials
    Then they should be taken to their dashboard
```

This scenario can be linked to automation code (e.g., using **Cucumber** or **Behave** for Python) to ensure the system behaves as expected.

### Key Benefits

- Reduces misunderstanding between teams
    
- Ensures software meets business requirements
    
- Creates living documentation
    
- Tests describe _what_ the system should do, making them easier to understand

### Tools

- **Cucumber** (Java, Ruby, etc.)
    
- **Behave** (Python)
    
- **SpecFlow** (.NET)
    
- **JBehave** (Java)
