INVEST (Agile foundation)
- Independent (of all others)    
- Negotiable (not a specific contract for features)    
- Valuable (or vertical)    
- Estimable (to a good approximation)    
- Small (so as to fit within an iteration)    
- Testable (in principle, even if there isnâ€™t a test for it yet)
